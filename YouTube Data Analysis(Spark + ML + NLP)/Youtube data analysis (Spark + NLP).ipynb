Integer identifier for the users commenting on the YouTube channels.\n● comment. Text of the comments made by the users.\n\nProject Highlights\n\nStep 1: Identify Cat And Dog Owners\nFind the users who are cat and/or dog owners.\n\nStep 2: Build And Evaluate Classifiers\nBuild classifiers for the cat and dog owners and measure the performance of the classifiers.\n\nStep 3: Classify All The Users\nApply the cat/dog classifiers to all the users in the dataset. Estimate the fraction of all users\nwho are cat/dog owners.\n\nStep 4: Extract Insights About Cat And Dog Owners\nFind topics important to cat and dog owners.\n\nStep 5: Identify Creators With Cat And Dog Owners In The Audience\nFind creators with the most cat and/or dog owners. Find creators with the highest statistically\nsignificant percentages of cat and/or dog owners.\n\nProject Purposes:\n- Identify pet owners so that we can send related advertisement for this user group. (e.g. pets food)\n- Understand what topics are those pet owners really interested in so that we can recommend them related videos and give advice for video creators with lots of pet owners fans."],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#### 0.

Whats wrong is government and society to think that a particular land belongs to them n if animals want to live on that space they have to live according to our rules.

That being said I have now got her hand command trained can trust her with my nephews cats but keep an eye on things. Beauty is a 5th generation Czech Wolf-Dog and Im in the UK so we have stricter laws than the states (cant own 1-3 generations without licenses outside of reservations). I was watching the video about so you want to get a wolfdog) its a bit scary dude and I get it I do and I do agree with you but I think your aiming it at the 1-3rd generations not the lesser generations and at Hybrids not breeds like the Czechs or Saarloos am I correct? But there was something that someone said to me once: If you want a slave dont get a wolf-dog; they are far too intelligent to be your slave. If you want a slave get a Labrador who wants to please you. That stuck with me and apologies for being crass about it it was such a strong comment Ive never forgotten it. With correct training bonding and excersing I have a wonderful loving wolf-dog who loves cats - which I was told by many experts wouldnt happen and she couldnt be trusted with them - they now curl up and sleep together! But the Digging - oh the digging! Haha I have massive mud pits she even managed to work out how to get the tap off of the water butt to create her own mud pool she can open ALL doors both directions so baby gates (extra tall) become your best friends! She also has severe separation Anxiety and cannot stand being separated from pack. But I have found that training to be a good leader and learning to communicate with beauty in her language helps a lot.I would be nice to chat to you as I would like to bounce ideas off of you in regards to wolf-dogs as Im planning on starting my training as a behaviourist and trainer and wish to specialise in the field of Wolf-dogs but not limit it to just one breed.

HELP! Lol a few weeks back I saw a video where you said you and a friend made a forum for Aquarists and for the life of me I cant find the video and dont remember the website... for days now Ive watched pretty much every video twice and my dumbass just cant find it... can anyone shoot me the link if they know it?! I love roughly 60 miles from San Antonio (south of SA) and Im in hopes Nicoles site will help me find amazing breeders and fellow aquarists in my area. I moved here from West Texas and away from the area I pretty much lived my whole life except for 5ish years when my ex husband and in the military but thats not important haha whats important is that I live in Bum fuck Egypt and the only store within a 50 mile radius that sells live fish is Petsmart and unfortunately its one of the worst Petsmarts Ive ever seen. I attempt to buy 2 plecos because I desperately needed them to try and help tackle an algae problem I had and both of them died within 24 hours they were each in separate 100 gallon tanks so I take them back with a water sample from both tanks. They test the water and say its perfect so thats when I whipped out the plecos and said well I bought these yesterday and they died and they told me it was because my water was bad even tho she JUST TESTED it and said it was great.. then when I say their fish died she automatically says it was because my water was bad... smh... I basically live smack in the middle of CorpusHouston Austin San Antonio theyre all approximately 100-110 miles away except I am a little closer to South San Antonio. I see amazing places in Houston but theyre on the east side of Houston which would be 130 miles one way which sucks when its an emergency or Im just needing one thing... Helps me guys!!! lol Ive had fresh water aquariums my entire 29 years of life and my mother also has as well as my grandmother and great grandmother but they also had /have saltwater as well. My gma also owned a fish store in Santa Barbra CA for a few decades before moving back to Texas but there is still SO SO SO MUCH I dont know and she doesnt know or has changed since she had her store 30 years ago so Id absolutely fucking love to have a place where well educated ppl can attempt to educate me.

My wife doesnt remember the first time she met me either lol. I was dating her friend at the time. When she came over to see what her friend was doing she brought her 2 wk old daughter with her. Her friend introduced me as a guy she met online she had her daughter packed up and on the road in less than a minute. The second time we met the first thing I said to her was SHUT UP I was hungover  she was being loud. 2 yrs later we were talking daily 1 year after that we were married.  Almost 9 yrs later here we are.  Happily married 2nd kid and a  house.  Like you said its funny how life works out.</td><td>0</td><td>1.0</td></tr><tr><td>OMG I cant believe Satan is gone.

However I do like your VLOG format where you mix things up showing the personal side of your life and doing snake related content. And occasionally I dont mind seeing videos that are not snake related at all as long as I get to see you changing stubborn tires in freezing weather! Peace brother!

This poor lady who got so badly hurt because she was led into a false sense of security by a ruthless money making idiot could have possibly stopped that horse if she had been taught how to but she wasnt unfortunately. To anyone reading this do not go outside of your safety zone for your sake and the horses sake no matter what anyone says. Stop and think is it safe to do this and if you have any doubt whatsoever dont do it. You are better off being alive than dead. For anyone else reading this who is going to buy a horse do not take a so called trainer with you to look at it. pay a vet to come with you a vet knows more about horses than any trainer ever will do. A vet will see if the horses that you are going to buy has been doped too enough for you to have a quiet little ride around an arena or menage on  so you buy it. They will dope the horse too when you pick it up or when they deliver it and within a couple of days the nice quiet horse you bought isnt so quiet believe me this happens in the horse world. Rick i am 60 this year and had my first pony at five he was straight off of Dartmoor and as wild as a coot my lifelong friend and i had no riding lessons or anyone to teach us we were told just to get on with it. This pony knew every trick in the book he bit us he cow kicked us he bolted with us he rubbed our legs along fences but we learned to lift our leg up alongside of his neck so we didnt get rubbed. We had a hoof oil brush taped to a long stick to oil his hooves when we tried to pick his tiny hooves up to clean them out it was like doing five rounds with an all in wrestler lol so funny. He had no withers to speak of and was flat backed we were bought a saddle for him which was about as useful as a bucket with a hole in it he put his head between his legs to buck and ourselves and the saddle ended up nearly on his neck so for three years we rode him bareback. The first year we had him we must have been dumped on on the ground more times than most people have had hot dinners but to us it was fun and Jason loved it it was all a game to him and he mastered the word naughtiness . We loved him more than anything in the world and by the time we were 8 we were like well trained athletes the muscles on our little legs were so strong to grip him and stay on we got a bigger pony each then and they were like driving Rolls Royces compared to an out of control rally car. The bigger ponies were not the same fun as Jason in the sense of what he got up to but we could go farther afield into the big world on them.  Jason was the best education we could ever of had and i owe 55 years with horses to him. If only ever child could have a Jason he spent the rest of his long years living with another pony and two Donkeys and passed away aged 28. Thank you Rick for educating people some people get things wrong through just plain lack of knowledge and others get things wrong because they are too ignorant to understand a horse.</td><td>0</td><td>1.0</td></tr><tr><td>You are so full of up yourself bullshit and lies. We carry first aid kits in a roll if you suggest once more that riding hats do not save lives i am going to report you to the BHS and have you named and shamed. Now i have ridden for 55 years without a riding hat and hey guess what ? no falls or injuries. BUT WHAT I WILL SAY TO ANYONE WATCHING THIS GIRLS SHIT IS  GET YOURSELF A RIDING HAT AND WEAR IT. SURGEONS CAN FIX BROKEN BONES BUT THEY CANT FIX CAVED IN HEADS THAT OFTEN AND IF A BRAIN SURGEON HEARD HER ADVISING PEOPLE NOT TO WEAR RIDING HATS SHE WOULD BE DISGRACED PUBLICLY. FROM THE FALLS AND INJURIES THIS GIRL HAS HAD SHE CAN NOT RIDE TO SAVE HER LIFE AND THAT IS FACT. I WOULD LOVE TO TAKE HER SADDLE AWAY FROM HER AND PUT HER ON ONE OF OUR FEISTY THOROUGHBREDS AND LET IT GO  SHE WOULD BE OFF IN SECONDS. Stop making these ridiculous dangerous videos ok. People how stupid is this girl ? she went out round a piddly little cross country course on her horse and my rabbit could jump higher than those toy jumps her horse did a small side side step and bucked and she came off severely damaging her leg also she had a riding hat on hypocrite or what ? Another incident she didnt take her mobile phone with her out riding on her own she said im going to leave my phone in my truck what the hell if she came off who is she going to call or get located by GPS. riding hats do not make good riders ok but they are designed for a purpose and that is to save your HEAD. You crack your skull and the chances are your brain will swell and squeeze out through the fracture. When your child is old enough to make their own mind up about their personal safety then you protect them children are a parents responsibility not this fools who would rather earn a few bucks by promoting a first aid kit which most sensible riders carry anyway than promote life. Also folks when out riding carry your medical details  contact numbers and your vets number and your horses name and  where your horse is kept and contact number for there and any meds you and your horse might be taking on a piece of paper or in a talisman around your neck this can save medics police  and vets crucial time in saving your life or your horses.

When I took her to the vet it was revealed that she was elderly shed been terribly abused and neglected and yes she was FIV positive. Did I want to have her put down right now the vet asked? Wanting to give this poor  baby just a few days of love and good food I said no. I held her that night and cried into her fur thinking about my other five rescue cats and wishing there was another way. I researched it the next day and learned a lot. Because FIV is mainly transmitted through deep bite wounds in a population like mine where hormones are at a minimum because everyone is spayed or neutered (the earlier the better!) the chances of infection are nearly non-existent.My little old traumatized girl turned out to be  sweet loving and grateful and is still with me today and though my rescue population has  increased throughout the years not one other kitty has been infected in all this time.</td><td>0</td><td>1.0</td></tr><tr><td>There just babys</td><td>0</td><td>1.0</td></tr><tr><td>So glad nothing puts me off my food as i was eating pizza when i watched this</td><td>0</td><td>1.0</td></tr><tr><td>Since You Tube is an American company can the SPCA be enlisted to fight this?

I will admit this could just be because Im jealous that Ive ridden my whole life and dont own a horse but yet Annies probably ridden about idk 3 times in her life before she bought Luna I feel very bad for Luna because she deserves an experienced rider thats been riding for awhile.

Before I started watching your videos I was that stupid girl in pink I am glad that I stumbled upon your videos because now I am 14 years old and I know how to understand a horse. I never grew up around horses so I didnt know anything. I occasionally took lessons as a birthday gift or a surprise but otherwise I was never around horses. As I got older and my parents realized I had a passion for riding they started introducing me to my second cousin Shauna more and more. The reason they did is because Shauna owns horses she helped me on understanding how to care for them and such but nothing else. Now as I am entering High School the school I am going to offers an equestrian team! I was very excited to hear but the only problem was I didnt own a horse. At this point in my life I know how to care for a horse and I am working on my canter. My parents realized this and decided to buy a horse that my second cousin Shauna was selling. They bought me tack and everything I needed. Now without watching your videos handling my horse (Faith) would have been much harder and maybe even more dangerous. But since I have watched your videos I find myself noticing Faith and her horse talk more and more. I even find myself just observing Faith for half an hour to an hour. Sorry for such the long background story and all but I just wanted you to know how much your videos especially have helped me and handling my horse. I appreciate you posting videos on what people are doing wrong and about how the horses communicate it is very helpful.

My brother is so passionate in telling me every Adventure you have and the stings and injuries you got. The funny moments are the best part. My brother is 13 and it reminded me about myself when I was you. I looked up Dr Brady Barr :). But ever since I saw your channel I remembered that feeling. The discovery of new animals and adventures. I would like to get the chance to win this Adventure pack for my brother so that we too can go on an adventure and use it. There are lots of cool places here in the Philippines :)So Im sure my brother will be super happy to have this item.

It was then that I discovered that they had tied the rope around his neck in such a way that pulling back from the wall would result in the rope rightening around his neck but not loosen.
